# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
[My Code Quiz!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-04-code-quiz/)  
For this week's homework, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions powered by JavaScript.  

## Installation
The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:
  1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
  2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
  3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
  4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website. 

## Mock-Up
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
